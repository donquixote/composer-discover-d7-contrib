# composer-discover-d7-contrib

This composer plugin flips the food chain of Composer in a way that will likely feel wrong to you.

It is designed for a very specific use case:

- You work on a Drupal 7 website where core and contrib are part of the git repository.
- You want to introduce Composer, e.g. to automatically download 3rd party packages required by some of the modules, without disrupting your existing workflow all too much.
